        Amogus is a bastardized version of the name of the 2018 video game Among Us.
         In January 2021, the word gained popularity as a catchphrase used in ironic memes,
          often used to replace dialogue in cartoons, and as a way of shitposting by spamming the phrase alongside sus.
           Additionally, Amogus refers to the simplified drawing of a crewmate from Among Us used in the memes.
            In May 2021, the Amogus panel regained popularity as a pop culture and history reference format, with the word altered to three-syllable names ending with "us,"
             such as "Columbus," and the panel redrawn accordingly.
